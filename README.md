# Users
FAMU students who drive to campus
## Required
- Users should be able to create their  account / sign in
- Users can set their parking location through a widget on the home screen
- Users already parked can see where they last parked

## Mobile
- Our app utilizes a widget that provides quick access to our app’s functionality
- Location, push notifications, real-time, maps

## Story
- People complain about parking every day, so the value of alleviating that stress is clear.
- With joy, they’d love to see it work.

## Market
- ~6k students including sophomore through grad students
- Yes
- Yes, students who drive to campus

## Habit
- At least 2 times/day Monday - Friday
- They consume (knowing parking locations) and create (set parking locations)

## Scope
- On a scale from 1 - 10, 6.
- We do not feel like working on a scaled down version of this project would still be interesting.
- Very defined. We have the idea, identified the users and their pain points and created an innovative solution to help alleviate those pains.
